# Installation

Download the **Record** program (**.exe** for windows or **.app** for Mac OS) from the **dist** folder, along with the desired **config.xlsx** file from the **configs** folder. Note that **Record** and **config.xlsx** must be located in the same directory for the program to work. Once downloaded, **Record** may be renamed. 

If you would like to be able to combine multiple spreadsheets into one master spreadsheet, then download the **Sync** program from the **dist** folder. Unfortunately, syncing spreadhseets is not currently supported on Mac OS.
